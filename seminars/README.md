# Various seminars on ML/DL

Here is the list of presentations I have pleasure to gave since 2016/2017 at our company: 

* The list is sorted in the chronological order. 
* Some of them contains additional materials like simple demos implemented in jupyter notebooks. 
* They may contain bugs and incorrect implementations etc.
* Slides are quite dense in information/equations etc (I like to have all details in the slides), so it is recommended to use Power Paint version (not pdf), since they contain transistions effects, so that one can easily follow the flow.
