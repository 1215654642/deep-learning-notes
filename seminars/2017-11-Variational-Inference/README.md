# Abstract:

The presentation covers the problem of Variational Inference (VI) method used to approximate 
posterior distribution over the model weights considered in a Bayesian framework. 
I will try to explain how does the VI work and how to use it in real life problems e.g. 
to estimate the uncertainty of model predictions.
